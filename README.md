Haskell solutions for Advent of Code 2021

## Content of repository

Every solution is represented by separate module DayXX in `./src` folder. Modules have standard interface: `part1`, `part2` functions that print result.

Data for problems is stored in `./input` folder, there are both real inputs and test inputs (latter end with `-test.txt`).
